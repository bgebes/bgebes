## ♟️ Best Decides Everytime! ♾️

Currently, I am actively developing my own projects while continuing my internship. In addition to these, as a 2nd year in Computer Engineering department
While I am studying, I also do lifelong learning for myself. If we talk about the entrepreneurial spirit, I have many startups as candidates and ideas to be submitted to production. Of course, I am open to investment offers so that I can put these initiatives into production.
