### Overview

I am a recent graduate in Computer Engineering at Ondokuz Mayis University,
with an excellent academic record and practical experience in software
development, project management, and leading. During this time, I took part
in various quality improvement activities as a representative of the class
and faculty while developing my communication and leadership skills. I
represented my university at industry events and also trained courses on
mobile app development, with the focus on Dart and Flutter.
<br /><br />
My technical expertise involves IoT-based systems, whereby a thesis project
involving real-time data collection and management using .NET, React, and
various wireless sensor technologies was developed. I have practical
experience as an Intern Software Engineer at isTechSoft Software, leading a
team in developing a mobile application with Flutter, GetX, Firebase, and
Firestore. This further honed my skills in software architecture, Agile
project management, and responsive design-ideally positioning me for a
career within technology-driven industries.
