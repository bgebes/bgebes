## That's me as an Life Developer! 😎

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a developer aiming to specialize in Javascript and at the same time doing an bachelor of engineering in computer science. I can describe myself as a front-end developer. I think that developers are entrepreneurs to a considerable extent, as they create appropriate solutions to problems and present them to users' experience. As an entrepreneur, I aim to prevent users from encountering such problems by producing solutions to the problems I experience every day. I am sure that such initiatives will create a better future for people. This is where my enthusiasm to start programming was born. You can review my initiatives and projects from the links on my github profile. By the way, thanks for reading this far. For all your complaints and suggestions, you can send an email without hesitation or open an issue for the relevant project. Nice to meet you. 🤝
